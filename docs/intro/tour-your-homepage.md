## Quick Links

The **Quick Links** tab is a customizable page where your most frequent searches or reports are just one click away.
This means that with quick links, you have a single point of access for the things you use most. Quick links are also fully customizable, so you can add and remove links from your quick links tab to meet your changing work demands. (Learn more about customizing quick links – including choosing output formats – in the Create quick links article.)

Many users start at the **Quick Links** tab to easily jump to the tasks they do each day, including:
- opening data entry views
- generating PDF lists
- generating aggregated status reports
- running your most frequent searches
